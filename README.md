How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves understanding their requirements through communication, observation, and analysis. These needs are then translated into user stories, which guide the design and implementation of features that provide real value. By focusing on what users actually need, you ensure that the final program effectively addresses their problems.

How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help by clearly defining what the user wants in simple, non-technical terms, allowing developers to focus on delivering features that matter. They also improve communication between stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the goals. This process keeps the team aligned with user needs, making development more efficient and user-centered.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Approaching program development involves breaking the project into manageable tasks, setting clear milestones, and iteratively refining the product. Agile processes like Scrum for sprints, Kanban for workflow visualization, and CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment will be valuable in future work. These methodologies allow for flexibility, continuous improvement, and faster delivery of high-quality software.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means collaborating effectively, taking responsibility for your work, and being open to learning and adapting. Supporting your teammates through mentoring and constructive feedback is crucial for a productive and positive team environment. Good team members contribute to the overall success of the project by being communicative, reliable, and willing to help others.
